# Video Transcription & Accent Analysis App

This project is a web application that extracts audio from videos, transcribes speech using Whisper, detects the speaker’s accent with SpeechBrain, applies noise reduction, and generates a summary of the transcription. The app is built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use interface.

## Features

- Upload or download videos from URL (including YouTube)
- Extract audio track from video using FFmpeg
- Optional noise reduction on audio
- Transcribe speech to text with Whisper (faster_whisper)
- Detect speaker’s accent using SpeechBrain pretrained model
- Summarize transcription with Hugging Face transformers (T5-small)
- Provide transcription stats: word count, speaking speed, keywords, and frequent words

## Supported Accents for Accent Detection

The system currently supports the following English accents:

| Code          | Accent / Region               |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **us**        | American (English - USA)      |

| **australia** | Australian (English - Australia) |
| **canada**    | Canadian (English - Canada)   |
| **india**     | Indian (English - India)      |
| **ireland**   | Irish (English - Ireland)     |
| **scotland**  | Scottish (English - Scotland) |
| **wales**     | Welsh (English - Wales)       |
| **bermuda**   | Bermudian (English - Bermuda) |
| **hongkong**  | Hong Kong English             |

| **philippines**| Filipino English             |
| **singapore** | Singaporean English           |

## How it Works
1. User uploads a video file or inputs a video URL.
2. The app extracts the audio track from the video.
3. Optionally applies noise reduction to improve transcription accuracy.
4. Uses Faster Whisper to transcribe audio to text.
5. Runs an accent classification model to detect the speaker’s accent.
6. Generates a brief summary of the transcription.
7. Shows detailed statistics about the transcription including speaking speed and keywords.
